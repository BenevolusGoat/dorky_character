v1.2
Didn't expect an update for this mod, huh?

General Adjustments
- Complete overhaul of the codebase. Primarily just a lot better to look at.
- Added HudHelper for use with Tainted Dorky's "Soul Drain Bar" for more accurate and dynamic positioning.
- Added "death item" sprites for Tongue Grapple and Soul Drain.
- Changed the descriptions for Tongue Grapple and Soul Drain to be less memey.
- Improved method of restoring correct character sprites upon Dorky or Tainted Dorky reviving as another vanilla character.
- Collecting a Blended Heart as Dorky now respect mods that resprite it

Mod Support
- Added EID support! Descriptions available for Dorky, his Tainted form, their birthrights, and pocket actives. Supports English and Spanish.
- Added POG costume for Tainted Dorky

API
- There really isn't an API, but the mod now has a "DorkyMod" global and exposes most of the functions and enumerations available in the mod. No mod will ever interact with this mod, but it's there, lol.
