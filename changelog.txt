v1.2
Didn't expect an update for this mod, huh?

General Adjustments
- Complete overhaul of the codebase. Primarily just a lot better to look at
- Added HudHelper for use with Tainted Dorky's "Soul Drain Bar" for more accurate and dynamic positioning
- Added "death item" sprites for Tongue Grapple and Soul Drain
- Changed the descriptions for Tongue Grapple and Soul Drain to be less memey
- Improved method of restoring correct character sprites upon Dorky or Tainted Dorky reviving as another vanilla character
- Collecting a Blended Heart as Dorky now respect mods that resprite it
- Fix bugs with gaining more Birthrights as Dorky and code not working with the increased paddle count
- Soul Drain's Black Heart bar no longer flashes when it is filled and no longer displays above "Strawman-like" copies of The Void

Gameplay Adjustments
Basically all Tainted Dorky and Soul Drain
- Increased Soul Drain's charge timer from 10 to 15
- Soul Drain's initial collision damage is now the same as when it deals damage over time (Isaac's damage * 2 + 1.5)
- You can disconnect the Soul Drain spike from an enemy manually by using Soul Drain again while its uncharged
- Soul Drain's spike will automatically detatch if the enemy is too far away from the player, too far outside of the room, or no longer considered a valid target
- Soul Drain's spike will now stay attached to enemies and not detatch except for the aforementioned conditions, but the normal cooldown is still present when attached to bosses
- Soul Drain now has support for being used in other active slots, used indirectly by other means such as ? Card, and by players other than Tainted Dorky
- Tainted Dorky can now collect Soul Hearts, but contribute to their Soul Drain bar instead of their health
- Using Soul Drain while it is already active will remove the currently active spike
- Soul Drain will no longer fully recharge itself upon failing to make contact with an enemy

Mod Support
- Added EID support! Descriptions available for Dorky, his Tainted form, their birthrights, and pocket actives. Supports English and Spanish
- Added POG costume for Tainted Dorky

API
- There really isn't an API, but the mod now has a "DorkyMod" global and exposes most of the functions and enumerations available in the mod. No mod will ever interact with this mod, but it's there, lol
