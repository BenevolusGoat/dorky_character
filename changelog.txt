v1.2
Didn't expect an update for this mod, huh?

General Adjustments
- Complete overhaul of the codebase. Primarily just a lot better to look at
- Added HudHelper for use with Tainted Dorky's "Soul Drain Bar" for more accurate and dynamic positioning
- Added "death item" sprites for Tongue Grapple and Soul Drain
- Changed the descriptions for Tongue Grapple and Soul Drain to be less memey
- Improved method of restoring correct character sprites upon Dorky or Tainted Dorky reviving as another vanilla character
- Collecting a Blended Heart as Dorky now respect mods that resprite it
- Fix bugs with gaining more Birthrights as Dorky and code not working with the increased paddle count
- Soul Drain's Black Heart bar no longer flashes when it is filled and no longer displays above "Strawman-like" copies of The Void

Gameplay Adjustments
- Soul Drain's spike no longer deals damage on initial contact with an enemy
- Progress on Soul Drain's Black Heart bar is now saved when exiting and continuing the run. Because I am lazy, it will only save whole numbers and not decimals
- All damage dealt by the player now contributes to Soul Drain's Black Heart bar, but to a much lesser extent, and is capped per instance of damage. Damage dealt by the Soul Drain spike is 1:1
- You can disconnect the Soul Drain spike from an enemy manually by using Soul Drain again while its uncharged
- Soul Drain's spike will automatically detatch if the enemy is too far away from the player on top of being outside of the room
- Soul Drain now has support for being used in other active slots, used indirectly by other means such as ? Card, and by players other than Tainted Dorky

Mod Support
- Added EID support! Descriptions available for Dorky, his Tainted form, their birthrights, and pocket actives. Supports English and Spanish
- Added POG costume for Tainted Dorky

API
- There really isn't an API, but the mod now has a "DorkyMod" global and exposes most of the functions and enumerations available in the mod. No mod will ever interact with this mod, but it's there, lol
